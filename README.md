Python Rock Paper Scissors(with a special technique!)  
# The Technique  
So, because rock is 1, paper is 2 and scissors is 3, the only possible numbers we get if we take the players number and subtract it with the random number, the only conditions the player can win are -2(rock beats scissors) and 1(paper beats rock, scissors beats paper).  
This way, we can use less if conditions so the code is simpler and easier to read.
